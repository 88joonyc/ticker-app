Keep in mind, other fees such as trading (non-commission) fees, Gold subscription fees, wire transfer fees, and paper statement fees may apply to your brokerage account.

                        to learn more. The line chart allows you to select different time spans ranging from 1 day to 5 years and each time span plots a time interval. The 1 day span and weekly spans, there is additional logic to only show the interval when trades occur. This allows you to see when trading volume occurs during periods of slower activity like extended hours or thinly traded equities. The candlestick chart works in the same manner.
